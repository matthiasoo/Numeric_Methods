# Numerical Methods in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical methods for solving mathematical problems. The following methods are considered:

## 1. Root Finding Methods

- **Bisection Method**  
  Finds the root of a function within a given interval by repeatedly bisecting the interval and selecting the subinterval where the function changes sign.

- **Regula Falsi (False Position) Method**  
  Similar to the bisection method, but uses linear interpolation between the endpoints of the interval to estimate the root more efficiently.

## 2. Linear System Solving

- **Gaussian Elimination**  
  Solves systems of linear equations by transforming the matrix into an upper triangular form using row operations, followed by back substitution to compute the solutions.

## 3. Interpolation Methods

- **Newton's Interpolation Method (Unequal Intervals)**  
  Constructs a polynomial that passes through a set of given points with arbitrary (non-uniform) x-coordinates. Uses divided differences to compute the coefficients of the Newton polynomial, allowing for efficient evaluation and extension to additional points.
