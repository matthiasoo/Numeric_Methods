# Numerical Methods in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical methods for solving mathematical problems. The following methods are considered:

## 1. Root Finding Methods:

- **Bisection Method**:  
  Used for finding the root of a function in a given interval. This method works by repeatedly bisecting the interval and selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign.

- **Regula Falsi (False Position) Method**:  
  A method similar to the bisection method but uses a linear interpolation between the endpoints of the interval to estimate the root.

## 2. Linear System Solving:

- **Gaussian Elimination**:  
  This method is used for solving systems of linear equations. It works by transforming the matrix into an upper triangular form and then performing back substitution to find the solutions.
